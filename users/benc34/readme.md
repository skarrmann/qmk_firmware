# A 34 key layout

Design principles

- Try to use similar fingers for keystrokes as are used on a standard ANSI
  QWERTY keyboard

- Two auxillary layers, one for numbers and symbols, the other for navigation,
  mods, enter, esc, copy, paste, etc

- One shot mods and layers so keys can be pressed sequentially, rather than
  needing to hold down modifiers

- Home row Callum-style mods, no mod-tap, no chords

- Numbers and symbols not on the base layer can all be typed by using only a
  single modifier, no layer+shift+key

- Function layer with F-keys, volume, media keys, etc.

- Mouse layer has left hand keys that are useful with the mouse: mods, copy,
  paste, etc.

Currently runs on Planck, Contra, and Ferris Sweep keyboards.
